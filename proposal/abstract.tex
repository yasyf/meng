\begin{abstract}
We enumerate several opportunities for software development and artificial intelligence to be applied to the day-to-day operations of seed-stage venture funds, and identify two such opportunities to build automated tools around. The first tool is a graph building and ranking system that ingests information and structure from the Internet, and outputs interesting (given a venture context) nodes. The second tool is a recommender system for early founders to find investors, alongside a public-facing tool to collect data and surface recommendations.
