\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{FounderRank}

Evaluation for the filtering subsystems of FounderRank is simple; we will use common model accuracy metrics to evaluate the ability to categorize webpages verses some naive baseline (for example, looking for keywords), as well as a random model. Evaluation for the system as a whole is more difficult, and is something we are actively researching.

\subsection{VCWiz}

Evaluating the VCWiz system will be difficult, but we can leverage historic funding event data from sources like CrunchBase to evaluate the relevance of our system's recommendations. We will use the evaluation metrics described in \cite{stone2014computational}, using a random model as a baseline, and a simple knowledge-based filtering system (given the industry of the startup in question) as a competitive alternative.
