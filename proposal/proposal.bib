	Abstract = {Previous researches on advanced representations for document retrieval have shown that statistical state-of-the-art models are not improved by a variety of different linguistic representations. Phrases, word senses and syntactic relations derived by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were observed ineffective to increase retrieval accuracy. For Text Categorization (TC) are available fewer and less definitive studies on the use of advanced document representations as it is a relatively new research area (compared to document retrieval).},

@article{Burke2002,
	Abstract = {Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

It discusses the work on the returns to venture capital investments. It also examines public policies, and the role of venture capital in the economy at large.},
