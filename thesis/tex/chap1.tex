\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis, we explore the creation of a tool, VCWiz, and a study on the data generated from this tool, with the purpose of leveraging software to improve the process of matching startup founders with venture capital investors. We begin by defining and detailing the inner workings of venture capital investments, and our models of the behaviors of both founders and investors. We explore the opportunities in venture capital to leverage software, and justify the selection of VCWiz, a comprehensive fundraising tool for seed-stage founders, incorporating discovery, research, and outreach functionality. Following this, we detail a study which explores the data generated by founders on VCWiz, using a graph of founders and investors to discover what social characteristics aid a founder in fundraising, and how investors can rank a set of founders based on these characteristics.

\textbf{TODO what else goes here?}

\section{Goals}

The goal of this thesis is to find an automated way to improve the founder-investor matching process. This entails making that process more efficient, in terms of the number and quality of successful matches that occur, but also more equitable. From the founder perspective, this means creating a tool which better equips a founder with the background knowledge, interfaces, and access necessary to find the right investors for their company. For investors, this means elucidating what exactly it means to find successful founder, and exploring how we can use existing information to better rank inbound investment opportunities.  We strive to create a tool and study which help both sides of the venture capital transaction achieve efficiency, without enforcing existing biases and stereotypes.

Specifically, our goals are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine the state of the tools and processes used for founder-investor matching today
  \item Build and evaluate a tool which helps founders match with their optimal investors
  \item Use the data from the tool to educate both founders and investors on efficient matching
\end{itemize}

\section{A Tool}

VCWiz is a comprehensive tool for seed-stage startup founders to raise their first round of financing. It is a holistic tool which covers discovering relevant venture firms, researching firms and investors of interest, and managing a structured outreach to those investors. This tool was developed over the span of eight months, with input from best-in-class founders and investors.

\section{A Study}

The data collected from VCWiz comprises the VCWiz Email Graph: a social-professional graph of founders, investors, their mutual connections, and the patterns of communication between all of them. This data is used in a study centered around FounderRank, a means of scoring founders based on the structure of the graph around them. The rankings generated by FounderRank educate investors on how to best use social relationships to evaluate a large set of founders who are being considered for a possible investment. Furthermore, these rankings demonstrate which social features of an individual are most crucial to successfully raising venture money.
