\author{Yasyf Mohamedali}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September,
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.
\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright\ \Mit\ 2018.  All rights reserved.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.

\supervisor{Rei Wang}{First Round Capital}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Katrina LaCurts}{Chair, Master of Engineering Thesis Comittee}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I'd like to thank the team at First Round Capital (specifically Rei Wang and Phin Barnes) for sponsoring this thesis, and Professor John Guttag for supervising it. Without your patience, guidance, and support, I would have never finished.

Next comes my family. To my mother, Feloza, and my father, Zeid, for pushing me to come this far, and being with me every step of the way. To my brothers, Afyz and Izayah, for giving me a reason to keep striving forward. To my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, whose encouragement never ends. Thank you.

Miscellanea: The fine folks at the Crunchbase Venture Program, for providing me with my initial dataset. Anthony Zhang and the fine folks at KnowYourVC, for being an awesome partner. Thomas Stone of UCL, for giving me a solid academic foundation to build on. Professor Tomas Palacios of the MIT VI-A program, for making this thesis possible. Professors Anantha Chandrakasan and Ron Rivest, for helping bring all the pieces together. The partners and portfolio of Dorm Room Fund, for being constant guinea pigs. $\text{Nate}^2$ at HealthWiz, for inspiring the VCWiz name. Josh Lee, for the best design job I've ever seen. Haris Memon, Nick Abouzeid and the team at ProductHunt, for an incredible launch. Fitz Tepper at TechCrunch, for an awesome article. Thank you.

And last but not least, to my friends. Alice, my best friend and partner, for having my back in whatever form was necessary, at any time. My cofounder Joe, for dealing with me at my worst and trudging on nonetheless. Bryan, for being my sounding board in the early days. Athena, for being my sounding board in the later days. Kimberli, for motivating me in the most difficult of moments. Divya, equally for helping me through tough times and for answering all my dumb questions.
