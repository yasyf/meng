The process of matching startup founders with venture capital investors is a necessary first step for most modern technology startups, yet there has been little effort to study the characteristics of the two parties and their interactions. Surprisingly little has been shown quantitatively about the process, and many of the common conclusions drawn are based on anecdotal evidence. In this thesis, we aim to learn more about this matching component of the startup fundraising process. We begin with a tool (VCWiz), created from the current set best-practices, to help inexperienced founders navigate the founder-investor matching process. The goal of this tool is to increase efficiency and equitability, while collecting data to educate further studies. We use this data, combined with public data on venture investments in the USA, to draw conclusions about the characteristics of venture financing rounds. Finally, we explore the communication data contributed to the tool by founders who are actively fundraising, and use it to learn the social attributes that are most beneficial for individuals to posses when soliciting investments.
