This thesis presents a tool and a study for increasing the efficiency and equity of the founder-investor matching process. We document the design, implementation, and launch of VCWiz, a public tool for first-time startup founders to research, discover, and reach out to their ideal seed-stage investors. The tool was built collaboratively with input from best-in-class founders and investors, and is currently used by thousands of founders actively. Data from this tool lead to the creation of the VCWiz Email Graph, a social-professional graph of founders, investors, and their intermediaries with edges based on frequency of emails between addresses. We present FounderRank, a methodology for ranking founders based on their position in their social graph, based on the characteristics of successful fundraisers. An analysis of FounderRank in the VCWiz Email Graph reveals that there is a high correlation between a founder's access to other nodes in the venture ecosystem and his or her ability to expeditiously raise a sufficiently large amount of capital.
