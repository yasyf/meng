# VCWiz

## Motivation

The culmination of our research and interviews with founders and investors was the proposal of VCWiz, a three-part platform geared towards helping first-time founders better research, discover, and outreach their optimial seed investors. The focus on seed-stage companies reflected the industry opinion that early-stage venture was an insider's game, where as later rounds of fundiner were more dependent on quantitative metrics around the companies growth, traction, and success. In the spirit of making venture more accessible and efficient, we chose to focus on first-time founders, who do not necessarily have the connections and tribal knowledge that makes their more experienced counterparts so much more likely to succeed.

We conducted a series of user interviews (N = 21) to determine which aspects of the platform would be most crucial, and what functionality the first version of this application should contain. The interviews were conducted across the spectrum of experience, from first-time student founders to industry veterans, based in New York, Boston, and San Francisco, and working on everything from novel social networks to machine learning-powered drug discovery. We also consulted with several reputable investors at top-tier firms such as First Round Capital and General Catalyst.

We can summarize our user interview feedback into the following three feaure buckets.

### Discovery

Founders often complain that it is difficult to discover the set of investors that are applicable to their startup. Investors, especially at the seed stage, have a plethora of conditions imposed on the capital they distribute, including restrictions on location, industry, target market size, business model, amount of capital being raised, valuation of the startup, and terms of the deal. Frustratingly, these conditions are rarely published anywhere, meaning it is difficult to query a list of investors to reveal the ones that match your conditions as a founder. This leaves founders resorting to overwhelmingly large databases of investors, or boutique, curated lists which might miss less well-known options for capital.

### Research

Once an eligible set of venture firms has been found, the burden on the founder only increases. In addition to figuring out the specific constraints mentioned above, each firm has preferences that may or may not align with the founder's vision for the company. Furthermore, in today's markets, where capital is widely available and there are many similar sources of capital, venture firms are fighting to differentiate themselves to founders, adding another degree of freedom to the ranking function each founder must internally maintain. "The evidence suggests that VCs' 'extra‐financial' value may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital" [1], but what exactly the extra-financial value of a firm is can often be difficult to uncover without a meeting or phone call. A vast increase in the number of new seed-stage funds being started further exacerbates the problem: venture research firm CBInsights claims that "the number of funds closed in 2014 was nearly 100% more than 2013" [2].

A seperate concern from the selection of the venture firm is the selection of the General Partner within the firm. Our data shows that there are an average of 4.68 partners per venture firm, with several other associates and supporting staff on the investment team. Each person often has an area of expertise and a type of company they prefer to consider, as well as a particular way to engaging with the companies they support. However, as before, there is no easy way to tell which parters prefer which industries or business models, making the selection process for founders laborious at best, and arbitrary in the average case.

### Outreach

The final major burden for founders who have identified and researched their ideal (seed) investors is to find a way to get connected to each one. It's commonly accepted in the industry that a so-called "warm introduction", that is, a direct introduction from someone who personally knows the investor, is the best way to start a conversation with a VC. Indeed, this is corroborated by the data. [3] shows that "direct ties are strongly and positively related to the probability of investment", in support of the hypothesis that "investors are more likely to invest in new ventures when they have a previously established direct tie to the entrepreneur than when they do not" [3]. The further removed a founder is in the global social graph from an investor, the less chance they will be able to get a direct introduction, and the lower the likelyhood of investment. However, for many first-time founders, it is simply impossible to get a direct introduction at all. The problem then shifts to finding the best "intro path" to a given investor, or barring that, sending the "cold" email which maximizes the chance the investor will consider taking a meeting. This process is often ad-hoc and confusing.

## Existing Solutions

Several solutions exist which solve one or many of the problems discussed above, but there has yet to be a comprehensive solution. As we will discuss later, the threshold at which a product is considered sufficiently feature-complete is very high. Though many of the founders we interviewed used pieces of these solutions, none of them were satisfied with the status quo, and every one thought that the state of existing tools could be improved.

### Crunchbase

Crunchbase [4] is an online database of companies, their founders, and the investors that back them. It was created "to be the master record of data on the world’s most innovative companies" [3], and is largely used as the first place founders go to learn more about a startup's investors. While the database is very comprehensive (and indeed was use to seed the database for VCWiz), it has historically been cumbersome to navigate, and the founders we interviewed found it to be a poor choice for discovery, though an excellent first step for research.

The database offered through the Crunchbase Data Venture Program [11] was used to seed the VCWiz investor database.

### AngelList

AngelList [5] is "a platform for startups", which focuses on early-stage companies and investors (both Angels and instituional seed investors). The core platform has social networking, and a directory of startups, their employees, and their early investors, akin to Crunchbase. AngelList's dataset is less comprehensive than Crunchbase's, and narrower in scope. Thus, the founders we interviewed found it less helpful for both research and discovery (though extremely helpful for recruiting employees).

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn [6] is a very popular professional networking platform that founders often use to find mutual connections to investors, so as to solicit introductions. The biggest complaint of founders using LinkedIn for this purpose was that it was not integrated into the rest of their workflow, though this was only expressed in a minority of those surveyed.

### NFX Signal

Signal [7] is a platform for founders to find introduction paths to VCs. Founders on Signal grant the application access to their Gmail inboxes, and in return can see the chain of people who comprise the shortest path to any given investor. The graph is built up based solely on email activity, and profile information for investors is self-reported. While this product successfully solves the problem of figuring out which individuals in one's network can provide the introduction to an investor, founders we interviewed often shyed away from using it, citing privacy concerns. Signal is operated by NFX Guild, a venture firm, and founders are often unclear about how their email data is being used.

The methodology for displaying investors on Signal [8] was the inspiration for the VCWiz ranking algorithm.

### Streak

The Streak CRM [9] is a popular Gmail extension whic embeds a spreadsheet-like customer relationship management (CRM) system in your mailbox. It tracks the progress of conversations, updating itself based on the emails being sent and received by the user. Streak offers a template set of headers and categories for fundraising [10], which is often used by founders. This means of tracking outreach and progress during a funding round was one of the most popular in the founders we iterviewed: there were very few complaints, other than that this setup still requires substantial manual data entry.

The spreadsheet-like interface for tracking conversations with Streak was the inspiration for the conversation tracker in the first version of VCWiz.

### Affinity

Affinity is a modern CRM solution which includes many features that make fundraising easier and more efficient. It is fully automated, with every conversation a founder has by email appearing on the platform, along with pre-filled information about investors and firms. It solves many of the qualms founders have with simpler CRM systems such as Streak, and includes a social graph which suggests introduction paths, as Signal does. The platform solves many of the common complaints around fundraising tooling, though it comes at a premium. Our interviews showed that many founders consider it to be too expensive to use.

### Foundersuite

Foundersuite is a comprehensive set of tools for fundraising. It is as sophisticated as Affinity, but developed specifically for founders. The CRM component of Foundersuite features a card-based system with manual updating of where each investor is in the fundraising pipeline. The software also includes a pre-populated database of investors which is used to autofill fields, and provide a search tool. Like Affinity, the common complaint with Foundersuite was the cost, and complexity.

The set of features and tools offered by Foundersuite were used as the starting feature set for VCWiz.

## Our Solution

The first step towards improving the founder-investor matching process is better tooling for both ends. Since founders are often the individual initiating an interaction, it makes sense to first focus on founders. After reviewing the existing solutions, and the feedback of founders as above, it's clear that there is an opportunity for a product which is sufficiently comprehensive yet much more accessible (with respect to cost and usability).

Fundraising can look very different at different stages of a company's life. While raising a pre-seed or seed round can entail leveraging a network to meet and impress sufficient investors until (at least) on decides to invest, later rounds of funding (e.g. Series A or B) are more predicated on the quantifiable traction of the company. Thus, a lot of the tools above are most impactful for seed-stage founders.

The process of fundraising also looks very different for the subset of founders that are so-called serial entrepreneurs: having raised money from institutional investors in the past means a founder no longer necessarily has the issue of discovering who they should take money from. Furthermore, "entrepreneurs with a track record of success are much more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs" [14]. Research on retail businesses shows that indeed, even outside of technology, "prior business experience increases the longevity of the next business opened" [12]. Indeed, the investing side of the equation also beleives this. Data from the First Round Capital 10 Year Project [13] indicates that "repeat founders’ initial valuations tended to be over 50% higher" than those of first-time founders.

Thus, in order to maximize the impact we have on the equity and efficiency of the founder-investor matching process, we opted to design a tool geared towards first-time founders, who are raising their first (seed) rounds. The tool has discovery, research, and outreach components, borrowing interfaces and functionality from the best of the above-discussed tools. We call our new tool VCWiz. VCWiz went through three iterations, each substantially changing the functionality and interface according to feedback solicited from users. We will first discuss the first iteration of VCWiz.

The solutions offered by VCWiz are split into the same categories considered above. We will first discuss the theoretical solutions to be offered by the tool, and then dive into the implementation and lessons learned. We will conclude with a detailed analysis of the various components of the final system.

### Discovery

To solve the discovery problem, we identified the several key characteristics which founders look for in a given venture capital firm. These include:

  - the location of the firm
  - the industries the firm has invested in
  - the average check size of the firm
  - the number of investments a firm makes anually
  - the companies a firm has invested in

The goal of the platform is to let the founder specify their preferences in any of these characteristics, and for the system to recommend relevant investors based on those preferences, and information collected about the founder (the stage, industry, and location, and competitors of their startup).

### Research

After surfacing recommendations to the founder, the platform strives to be the single location with all the relevant information about the partners of a given venture firm. The goal is that the founder never has to leave VCWiz (or a site linked from VCWiz) in order to make a decision about an investor. To this end, in addition to the characteristics necessary for discovery, we collect and report several other pieces of information:

  - The most recent investments of the firm
  - The most recent investments of a given partner at the firm
  - The firms that often invest alongside a firm ("co-investors")
  - The specific industries that a partner focuses on investing in
  - The topics a partner often discusses online
  - Links to online profiles and content created by the firm or a partner
  - Biographic and demographic information on a partner

### Outreach

Finally, once a founder has filtered their recommendations using the research tools on the platform, the final job of VCWiz becomes to ensure the founder can begin a conversation with their desired investors. To measure progress on this front, the platform contains a "conversation tracker": a CRM which auto-populates the profiles of investors marked as desireable by the founder, and auto-updates as the founder has conversations with those investors. The goal of this CRM is to be as automatic as possible, making assumptions wherever it can.

In addition to simply tracking conversations, VCWiz offers two tools for initiating them. The first is a NFX Signal-style introduction path system, which leverages the social graph of the founder to identify the optimal shortest path to any given investor, if one exists. The second tool is a structured system for automated introductions: the founder can request an introduction to an investor, who gets a consistantly-formatted, auto-generated dossier on the startup. The investor then has the choice of accepting or rejecting the introduction request. This system is an experiment to see how structure and consistancy can improve the process of cold outreach, and is discussed later.

#TODO ask investors why they didn't respond

## Our Story

### V1

We first spent time talking to 21 teams of startup founders going through YCombinator and other well-known accelerators, right as they were about to begin raising their seed funding rounds. They all identified a need for personalized suggestions of investors. Our initial idea was to collect information from each founder on their ideal investor (characterizing investors and firms with features such as industry, check size, and location), and generate suggestions from a cluster of similar investors (uusing an item-based k-nearest neighbors model, as in [15]). With this in hand, we build the first iteration of the VCWiz application.

The first version of VCWiz collected a founder's ideal investor profile (based on the characteristics identified above), as well as basic company information, before taking them to a screen of recommendations. The founder had the option to add any of the recommended investors to a list of ``target investors'' to begin tracking them, and was then taken to the main card-based view of the app. This view presented a series of stages, detailed below.

  - Waiting for Into
  - Waiting for Response
  - Need to Respond
  - Interested
  - Not Interested

Investor cards, which showed summaries of a partner at a firm, alongside community notes on both the partner and firm, could be moved between stages through dynamic buttons, which captured the transitions between stages. At this time, data collected on platform usage was not leveraged, save for sorting the recommendations for new users by popularity in the existing user base.

#TODO: screenshots of v1

We learned a few crucial insights through the launch and test of this first iteration of the application.

With respect to discovery, we realized that founders do not find investors by looking at clusters of similar investors from a few seeds, as our model assumed. Instead, investors were found by examining the previous investors of similar companies to the one in question. While it meant that our kNN-based approach performed poorly for users, it reduced our discovery problem to a version of the very popular Netflix Prize~\cite{netflixpize} problem. Similar users (founders/companies) were positive about similar products (investors). We could now apply an entire body of recommendation-system research to the problem.

With respect to research, the biggest mistake we made was to include only a subset of the information we identified as useful for the founder. As a result, founders would end up leaving the platformt to do further research, which was disruptive to their workflow.

With respect to outreach, the first major learning was that it was very difficult to convince founders to trust us with their investor conversations, and that anything we could do to build credibility (for example, auto-filling form fields or leveraging the brands of the venture firms we were working with) vastly increased willingness to share data.

The next big learning was that our users were very familiar with a spreadsheet-based experience (either through Streak or with actual spreadsheets), and that trying to replace it was difficult and unnecessary. A very common piece of feedback was that a "smart spreadsheet" would be a far superior interface to the existing card-based workflow.

### V2

The second version of VCWiz featured a new recommendation engine, which first asked founders to identify competitors (or similar companies) which are more established. These companies were used to generate recommendations based on a simple algorithm, which takes the set of investors from the identified competitors, filters out the eligible ones, and sorts them based on their relevance, popularity, and whether or not they are featured. The popularity of investor $i$ is calculated based on the number of founders who have added $i$ to their outreach list.

  ```
  def recommendations(founder):
    investors <- founder.company.competitors.flat_map(c => c.investors)
    eligible <- investors.filter(i => i.industries \cap founder.company.industries \neq \emptyset)
    sorted <- eligible.sort(i => [i.featured, |i.industries \cap founder.company.industries|, i.popularity])
    return sorted
  ```

Another addition to the second version was an augmented spreadsheet interface, which looks and feels like a spreadsheet, but auto-completes information about investors based on a VCWiz investor database. Once sufficient information had been entered on an investor into a row of the sheet to uniquely identify one record in the database, the remaining fields were filled. This gave the founders an experience they were comfortable with, with the power and ease of use they expected to justify switching tools.

In order to build up the VCWiz investor database, we started with a dataset imported from the Crunchbase Data Venture Program [11], then further augmented it with serveral additional sources. We will discuss our data pipeline in depth below.

The venture firms in our database are now tagged with the stage of company they invest in, based on the latest fundraising round that has occured. These categories are defined (and ordered) as such.

  - Accelerator
  - Angel
  - Pre-Seed
  - Seed
  - Series A
  - Series B
  - Venture

N.B. These categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, an accelerator may indeed give a startup their pre-seed round. The category for "Venture" captures all growth-stage companies (Series C and later).

Finally, we refined the stages a tracked investor could fall into, based on feedback from founders who were currently fundraising. The list below indicates the ordering over stages that is used throughout the platform.

  - My Wishlist
  - Asked for Intro
  - In Talks
  - Need to Respond
  - Pitching
  - Committed
  - Passed
  - Not Interested

#TODO: screenshots of v2

Following the completion of the second iteration of VCWiz, we did another series of user tests, asking founders to focus specifically on the improvements over the first version.

On discovery, the recommendations were not granular enough, and it was unclear why a certain investor was being recommended. Founders expressed the desire to filter and sift through investors with certain queries (such as some subset of the characteristics being used for recommendations), instead of being blindly handed what appear to be random investors. While there was still a desire for recommendations, it seemed that the place for this was after some amount of filtering, rather than in place of the filtering.

On research, it was felt that the platform still did not provide sufficient information to make it worth using over another tool. Nor did it display the little information it did show in an easy-to-digest way. A common suggestion was to incorporate content from social media and blogging platforms, as investors often use these platforms to demonstrate their interests.

On outreach, the major feedback was that the platform was too rigid. Having pre-defined stages and fields made it difficult to customize the tool for each founder's slightly different workflow, and made them feel like they were fighting the platform, instead of being empowered by it. A common feature request was some way to leverage mutual connections in the outreach.

We used Reichheld's Net Promoter Score (NPS) [16] to track the growth potential of the product with respect to founders. At this stage, the product had an NPS of -50, which is very weak. Only 25% of founders said they would recommend the product to a friend.

### V3

The third iteration of VCWiz was started September of 2017, and aimed to incorporate all the previous feedback. The goal was for the end result to be a production-ready product that launches publicly. The interface and interactions were redesigned from the ground up, this time with the help of a professional designer. The functionality is still split across the three categories of discovery, research, and outreach, though each is now as feature-complete as the competing products which solve a narrower need. We embraced the feedback from fiunders that the product needed to be comprehensive and holisic, and have improved upon any of the popular features on other platforms.

We will first give an overview of the features of the third and final iteration of the platform, followed by an in-depth analysis of each component.

#### Disovery

VCWiz's initial screen contains an interface to filter and search for investors, by all the characteristics discussed previously, as well as by name and more novel metrics, such as topics often discussed. There are also options to constrain and modify the filters, such as changing a filter from a logical OR to a logical AND. In addition to the filtering and searching, there are curated lists of investors that meet specific criteria, ordered by popularity, and selectively shown to founders based on characteristics of their startup.

#### Research

Clicking through from any of the results in the filter view bring up a research screen which displays comprensive information on both a firm, as well as every partner at that firm. Every piece of information mentioned in interviews by founders as being useful is included in this view, including but not limited to biographies, social media links, recent investments, press mentions, blog posts and tweets, favorite topics to talk about, industries often invested in, and common co-investors.

#### Outreach

The outreach functionality of VCWiz is embedded in every screen, as well as having a decdicated dashboard.

Every tool for research and discovery has buttons to add investors and firms to the VCWiz Tracker, a CRM which is synced throughout the platform. Founders see a contextual dropdown showing the status of an investor in their pipeline any time they are researching that investor or their peers. The conversations screen is a dashboard which shows a table-like view, contiaining the information that was previously put in spreadsheets. We used a table to strike the balance between giving founders an interface they were familiar with, and displaying the information in a sufficiently detailed way. The data in this table is populated and updated through an integration with the founder's email provider.

In addition to merely tracking conversations, this version of VCWiz also overlays each screen containing details about an investor with a subset of the founder's email graph, showing them the shortest path(s) to the given investor in their network. This allows the founder to understand how likely they are to be able to reach an investor without a click.

Shortly after the public launch of this third version of VCWiz on January 25th, 2018, we surveyed active founders on the platform to again calculate the NPS. This time, we received 117 responses, with an NPS of 0, a significant jump from the last version. 63% of users agreed that they would recommend VCWiz to a friend, up dramatically from 25% previously.

## Our Implementation

### Onboarding

Founders find the VCWiz platform through one of our launch partners, or from search engines such as Google. We spent the months leading up to the launch generating research pages for every investor, firm, and company in our database. These pages include comprehensive details on the entity in question, as described above, as well as an embedded view of all the VCs associated with that entity, and, if the user is signed in, all the personalization included in the platform.

#TODO firm screenshot, cite https://vcwiz.co/firm/79/spark-capital
#TODO techcrunch screenshot, cite https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/dorm-room-fund-has-built-a-crm-for-founders-raising-a-seed-round/

After funneling users from their landing page to the main screen of the application, founders are able to filter, search, and explore lists of investors without creating an account. The site is fully functional from a discovery and research perspective, and about 80% of users are content to peruse the content without creating an account. If the founder decides to create an account, we walk them through a series of questions to gather more information about their startup.

#TODO landing page screenshot

The signup flow begins by asking for the domain of the company. Using this as a unique identifier, we are able to query both our internal database, as well as external services (such as the Clearbit Logo API [17]) to gather as much information as possible on the founder's startup. The client browser makes a request to an API backend on the VCWiz server which initiates these requests in parallel, and returns a joined \texttt{Company} model within a given timeout threshold. This information is used pre-fill many of the following fields, including the name, description, industries, and competitors of the company. The founder is given a chance to verify this information, as well as provide mandatory information on their ideal investor profile. Finally, the founder is requested to log in with their Google account, in order to provide an authenticated email and social profile. We chose to use an OAuth2 [18]-based login flow with an existing service provider to simplify the login experience, and to avoid having to store user credentals. Google was the platform of choice on account of it providing verified email address information to users, as well as to unify the authentication experience in the case that the founder also decides to provide API access to their email inbox (for the purpose of synchronising their coversations with investors).

Providing access to their email inbox is strictly an opt-in feature, and the how the data is to be used is explicitly described. As a result of our surveys to founders in previous iterations of the prodcut, we found that it was necessary to have a plain-English description of our data use polcity. We guarantee to founders that no human will ever read the individual messages of their inbox, that only aggregate data will be used for purposes other than their personal dashboard, and that we will only use metadata from their emails (headers, sentiment, etc.).

After signing up, the founder is presented with a brief set of video clips that introduce the functionality to them, including how to filter, search, and track investors. Following this, the site functions as it did before the founder signed up, with a few minor changes. Every screen with an investor has an integrated conversation tracker which shows the status of that investor, if any, in the founder's fundraise, as well as the email-based shortest intro path to that investor. The results of the filters are also personalized to the founder, based on the overlap in industries and location between each firm and the founder's startup. Signing up also unlocks the conversation tracker, with a preview of conversations on the main page, and a dedicated screen for updating and viewing the status of each individual conversation.

#TODO: screenshots of intro, summary, and conversations

### Ingesting User Data

One of the major insights from previous iterations of VCWiz was that founders have a variety of different ways they create and interact with data about their fundraising process, and they aren't often willing to change those. Thus, the tool we built had to meet founders wherever they currently were, in order to get their conversation tracker on our platform caught up. We built three independent tools for letting the system know about ongoing conversation, in addition to the integrations in the research and discovery sections.

The first (and easiest) way founders can import their conversations to the platform is to grant access to their Gmail inbox, either during the signup flow or when later prompted. This allows a regularly-scheduled job on our server to poll an API offered by Google [22], and import new messages according to the following pseudocode. A \texttt{history_id} parameter is cached in the \texttt{Founder} model to indicate the most recent thread fetched from Google, to avoid fetching duplicates in the future.

  ```
    def sync_inbox(founder):
      for thread in fetch_threads(founder.address, founder.history_id):
        messages <- thread.fetch_messages()
        for message in messages:
          if message.from == founder.address:
            parse_outgoing(founder, message)
          else:
            parse_incoming(founder, message)
        founder.history_id <- thread.id
  ```

Parsing messages follows the following algorithm, which also augments the founder's email-based graph with every email processed.

  ```
    def parse_message(message):
      if check_if_bulk(message):
        return
      founder.graph.connect(message.address)
      target_investor <- find_or_create_target_investor(founder, message)
      if !target_investor:
        return
      if !target_investor.email:
        target_investor.email <- message.address
      target_investor.stage <- guess_stage(message)
      create_new_email(founder, target_investor, message)
  ```

As can be seen from the algorithm, when importing a user's emails and creating their email graph, we first started with the naive approach of scanning every email, creating a node (if one did not already exist) per address, and creating outgoing edges every time one node sent an email to another. While this works when only importing emails once, the APIs at our disposal were imperfect. The \texttt{history_id} tracked from Google's API often expire, and imports must be repeated. Thus, we had to start tracking a unique message identifier in our own database to ensure emails are imported at most once.

There were also several heuristics we used to skip messages that could be classified as bulk mail, as this added a lot of noise to the dataset. If the message meets any of the following criteria, it is logged and skipped. The full algorithm can be found at [23]. In these criteria, the recipients are defined as the union of the TO, CC, and BCC fields, and body is defined as the concatenation of the text and HTML sections of the message.

  - There are more than 5 recipients
  - The body contains a phrase often used in bulk mailings, such as "unsubscribe", "terms of use", or "view in your browser"
  - The headers contain one of sereval common listserve headers, such as List-Unsubscribe and many vendor-specific ones
  - The return path of the message includes a popular bulk email vendor
  - The local component of the from address is that of a commonly-automated inbox, such as "noreply" or "info"
  - The name of the sender includes common aliases, such as "support" or "payroll"
  - The domain of the sender or any recipient is one that is common in transactional emails

The second way founders can inform the system about ongoing conversations is to CC (or BCC) a special email address, which routes to a server which accepts the message and forwards the relevant metadata to an API endpoint on VCWiz. This metadata is parsed and the email is reconstructed, before being run through the same algorithms as above. This alternate, manual way of updating VCWiz via emails was added for the more privacy-consious founders on the platform, who wished to have the convenience of updates based on emails without handing over access to their entire inbox.

The third and final ways founders can update the system in bulk is by uploading a existing spreadsheet of conversations. Our surveys revealed that the most commonly-used tool for tracking conversations with an investor was a spreadsheet (or spreadsheet-like tool), so providing an easy way to migrate those onto the platform was essential. Founders can export a CSV file from any spreadsheet-based tool and import it on the conversation tracker page of VCWiz. The server parses the rows out of the CSV, and uses both the format of the content of a column as well as it's header (based on the Levenshtein distance [24] of a given header from a list of common choices) to guess which columns correspond to which internal database columns of a \texttt{TargetInvestor}. This mapping is presented to the founder for verification, and then is used to import the rows as a background job.

#TODO: screenshot of import

### Data Pipeline

There are serveral sources of information used by the data pipeline in VCWiz, each of which is abstracted, normalized, and merged into the existing schema of the system.  Instead of attempting to mirror the structure of each API in the server code, a wrapper class (\texttt{ApiObject} [25]) was created, which abstracts away common structure in the external API endpoints accessed. This allows simple property-based access of the JSON objects returned, with automatic detection of arrays and types which need to be converted (such as dates). The general method for building up profiles of objects in VCWiz is to start with a base source of truth (often Crunchbase), then augment these objects with a variety of information streams, some of which are documented below.

#### Crunchbase

Through the Crunchbase Data Venture Program [11], we received access to the entire database of investors, firms, and companies on Crunchbase. Each \texttt{Company}, \texttt{Founder}, \texttt{Investor}, and \texttt{Firm} on VCWiz stores a unique Crunchbase identifier (\texttt{crunchbase_id} or \texttt{cb_id}), which allows changes on Crunchbase to be reflected in VCWiz models (when appropriate). Whenever an object with associations that have Crunchbase identifiers is updated, background jobs are initiated which attempt to fetch updates for each association. Furthermore, approximately once a month, a complete dump of the Crunchbase database is downloaded and imported (skipping over existing records).

#### AngelList

Each \texttt{Company}, \texttt{Founder}, \texttt{Investor}, and \texttt{Firm} also has a field for storing an AngelList [5] identifier. The AngelList API [26] is used to augment information on these objects when Crunchbase is ambiguous or incomplete. Through manual inspection, we found that AngelList's dataset often contains more information for companies which are so early-stage that they have not yet raised money from institutional investors, whereas Crunchbase focuses on venture-backed startups.

#### Bing News Search API

The Bing News Search API [27] is used to periodically check for previously-unseen news articles on a given investor. These news articles are imported and processed, which involves summarizing them, extracting entities from their bodies, and categorizing their sentiment. All of this information is saved to a \texttt{News} record, which is displayed to users on the research page for a \texttt{Investor}.

#### Newsriver

Newsriver [28] is a similar API to Bing News Search, and is also used to monitor for new press on an investor.

#### Clearbit

Clearbit [29] is a service which provides access to a dense graph of human profile information, with nodes that can be identified with an email address or social media profile. We use it to auto-fill parts of the profiles on VCWiz, both for founders and investors.

#### Text Processing API

We use the Text Processing API [30] for entity recognition and sentiment analysis of many pieces of text, including news articles and emails.

#### Google Cloud Natural Language

We use the Google Cloud Natural Language API [31] for the same reasons as the Text Processing API.

#### Hunter

Hunter [32] is a service which collects common email patterns on a per-domain basis to aid in guessing a person's email address given their name and domain. We use it to guess the emails of investors who have not signed up for the platform yet, when a founder requests an introduction to them.

#### Twitter

We use the APIs provided by Twitter [33] combined with the social media usernames reported by Clearbit to log recent tweets of every individual investor on the VCWiz platform. These tweets are displayed on the research page for the investor. Entities are extrated from these tweets, and are used to build a profile of the topics affiliated with an investor.

#### Medium

Medium [34] is a popular platform for blogging. When an investor has a profile on Medium, it is scraped regularly to identify new blog posts to display on the research page. Like tweets, entities are also extracted from blog posts for analysis.

#### Homepages

The homepages of investors, firms, and founders are all scraped for entity extraction, similar to the blog posts and news articles above.

### Security

The dataset and internal API endpoints exposed by VCWiz present a large opportunity for abuse. The resources required to build and maintain the database of investors, firms and companies are considerable, and every other site which presents a similar dataset goes to great lengths to discourage web scraping and other illegitimate access. Often, sites will employ the services of a company such as Distil Networks [35], which uses a variety of Javascript-based methods to make it difficult or impossible to programatically get the HTML of a webpage. Since VCWiz exposes a JSON API to the public internet, it was necessary to take percautions against anything other than the VCWiz frontend accessing internal resources. Furthermore, additional measures were put in place to make sure no one could access a founder's data, other than that founder themselves.

The security of the entire application is handled through a few efforts. All data is stored in a single database, with credentials stored as an environment variable on the web server. These credentials are rotated automatically on a regular basis. Any API keys or further credientials are also stored as environment variables, never recorded in code. User sessions are encrypted with a private key only held by the web servr, and serialized into client cookies. These sessions contain the primary key of the currently logged-in \texttt{Founder}, if any, and is used to ensure that no one can access a founder's data without authorization.

When it comes to the API specifically, we want to prevent both unauthorized reads (of user or bulk data) and writes (that a user did not intend).

Writes across founders are defended against with the measures described above. A common attack vector for an unauthorized write is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF). CSRF is when "a malicious site instructs a victim’s browser to send a request to an honest site, as if the request were part of the victim’s interaction with the honest site" [36]. In this case, a malicious site could send a request to a VCWiz API, impersonating the currently logged-in founder to, for example, request an introduction from an investor with arbitrary text. This could be very damaging for the founder, and so is addressed by embedding a request-specific key in the meta tags of each page. This key is parsed by the frontend application, and sent in a header to the API with every request. If the key is present, the request must be from a legitmate source. If it is absent or missing, the request is illegitimate and is rejected before being routed.

Preventing read abuse of internal APIs is accomplished through a combination of expiring server grants to clients and rate-limiting. Whenever a non-API page is loaded on VCWiz, a timestamp is set in the encrypted user session. Whenever an API request is made, this session timestamp is compared to the current server time. If more than one hour has elapsed, the API request is reject with a \texttt{401 Unauthorized} status code. This ensures that the only clients who can make API requests are the ones representing active users on the website. Of course, there are times where this can result in a legitimate user being denied (because, for example, they left the page open and came back an hour later). In the cases where the API abstraction layer on the frontend receives a \texttt{401}, it simply triggers a refresh of the page, thereby refreshing the server grant. Since it would be possible to obtain a grant for malicious purposes, the API is also rate-limited by session identifier and IP address.

### Performance and Caching

#### External APIs
  - ambiguity in parsing
  - stoplight model

### Production System

  - Ubuntu-based servers on AWS, with heroku
  - managed posgres, neo4j, redis, and memcached
  - React [21], frontend frameworks, etc
  - backend is rails, etc


### Filtering & Searching

#### Filtering

The main filtering interface of VCWiz allows founders to display investors that match a set of criteria. We will detail each of those criteria before describing the algorithm used to filter. The logic behind the selection of criteria is to cover the majority of the ways founders describe their ideal investor: the stage the investor operates at, the industries that they invest in, the location they invest in, and their relationship to similar/competing companies (similar companies are generally a good sign, whereas directly competing companies might be prohibative).

The first criteria is based on the stage of the company, as defined by it's latest funding round. It is a filter on the funding round a venture fund investests in, either as reported by the fund, or based on their past investments. Note that a fund can have multiple stages affiliated with it, as can a funding round of a company (often in the cases of ambiguity); when aggregating past investments, any stage which shows up at least half of the time is attributed to the fund. This criteria is always a logical \texttt{OR} when multiple are selected.

The next criteria is the set of industries that a fund commonly invests in. Once again, these are preferrably self-reported, and there can be multiple associated with a fund (as well as an investor or a company). They are aggregated in the same was as the stage. The set of industries are fixed: there is no free-form option when filtering. The set of industries to display as options [37] was selected using the following algorithm, on all the companies in the Crunchbase data set. The goal is to select the set of industries that cover the entire set, with minimal overlap.

  ```
    def covering_industries(companies):
      all_industries <- companies.flat_map(c => c.industries)
      industry_options <- all_industries.unique().sort_by(i => all_industries.count(i))

      selected <- set()
      while companies.filter(c => c.industries \cap selected \neq \emptyset).count() > 0:
        selected <- selected \cup industry_options.pop()

      return selected
  ```

By default, when a founder selects multiple industries, the filter is a logical \texttt{OR} of these industries. However, there is an option which can be toggled to make this filter an \texttt{AND}, such that returned companies have to invest in \textit{all} the specified industries.

The next criteria is based on a set of cities. By default, this filter returns firms which are based in the cities specified (firms have a single heaquarters, and an array of locations, which are both matched against). There is an option, however, to change this filter to instead return firms that have invested in \textit{startups} based in the specified city (each startup is affiliated with a single city).

Another criteria to be matched against is a set of relevent startups. The founder can select this set from the database of companies VCWiz tracks internally. By default, this set restricts the returned firms to those who have invested in at least one of the specified companies. An option can be toggled which changes this filter to restrict to the set of firms that have invested in \textit{similar} companies, based on the industries of each company in the set.

The final criteria to match investors against is a set of topics. In this case, a topic is anything found in the VCWiz knowledge graph, built up by extracting entities from the various data sources discussed elsewhere. This filter is a logical \texttt{OR}, and will return investors who often mention or discuss any of the given topics. In this case, we include a topic for an investor if that topic is mentioned at least 5\% of the time in content created by or mentioning the investor.

Finally, here is a lone option to restrict the returned set of investors to those that operate solely in the US. This was a popular criteria for many founders on our platform.

#### Searching

In addition to filtering against any combination of the above criteria, founders can also filter investors based on the name of the firm or individual investor. This is implemented as a simple fuzzy string match on the \texttt{name} field of \texttt{Firm}, and the \texttt{first\_name} and \texttt{last\_name} fields of \texttt{Investor}.

#### Sort

Once VCWiz have generated the set of investors that match each filter and search query, it must decide the order in which to display the results. There is a custom ranking function which sorts the results, using each metric as the tie-breaker for the last.

  1. If the topic filter is present: the number of investors in the firm which match the set of topics
  2. The number of "featured" investors in the firm
  3. If the industry filter is present: the number of intersecting industries between the firm and the query
  4. If the city filter is present: the number of intersecting cities between the firm and the query
  5. The number of founders on the platform who have initiated a conversation with the firm
  6. The number of "verified" investors in the firm

N.B. Any metric which does not have it's requirement met is simply ignored. "Featured" investors are those on the platform who have been hand-picked as high-quality investors. "Verified" investors are those who have completed their investor profile on VCWiz self-reported their characteristics.

This sort acheives personalization by using the industries of the founder's startup and current location of the founder for the purpose of sorting, when the respective filters for those characteristics are not specified. Thus, if a founder specifies all the possible filters, they will get the same results that any other founder who does the same will. However, if the relevant filters are unspecified, information from the founder's profile will be used for ranking and displaying the results, giving a different ranking than some other founder.

The interface displayed to the founder also allows for manual sorting of the results based on the natural ordering of a given column. If this overriding sort is provided, none of the above is used.

#### Implementation

The algorithm for displaying the results of this process [38] is simple.

We start with every firm in the database, and filter out any that do not match the search terms provided by the founder. Often, the search term is given as a single query string. In this case, we treat this string as both the query for the firm name, as well as the investor name (the first word of the string is considered the query for the first name, and the remainder for the last name). Any individual investors who match have their firms added to the results.

Following the search query, we apply every present filter to the remaining set of firms, narrowing down the result set each time.


  ```
    def recommendations(all_firms, founder, filters, search):
      firms <- all_firms
      investors <- firms.flat_map(f => f.investors)

      if search:
        first_name, last_name = extract_name_components(search)
        investor_by_name <- investors.filter(i => i.first_name.contains(first_name) || i.last_name.contains(last_name))
        firms_by_investor_name <- investor_by_name.map(i => i.firm)
        firms_by_name <- firms.filter(f => f.name.contains(search))
        firms <- firms_by_name \cup firms_by_investor_name

      for filter in filters:
        firms <- apply_filter(firms, filter)

      sorted <- apply_ordering(firms, founder, filters)
      return sorted
  ```

#### Display

The results from the filtering and searching process are displayed in an infinitely-scrollable table to the founder, with the following columns.

  1. The name and photo of the firm
  2. The company stages the firm invests at
  3. The headquarters of the firm
  4. The number of investments the firm has made in the last calendar year ("pace")
  5. The top three industries that the firm invests in
  6. A drop-down to add or update the firm in the conversation tracker

N.B. What founders really desire to see in the "stage" column is the average cheque size of the firm. However, this number is difficult if not impossible to calculate given the limited public data on investor contributions to a given fundraising round. Thus, the company stage is used as a proxy.

The "pace" column is present to give the founder a sense of how active a given firm is. This was added by popular request after many founders found it difficult to determine whether or not a firm was still actively investing their current fund.

#TODO results screenshot

Each column (other than "industries") also provides a button for overriding the ranking function. This allows the founder to view the result set, sorted by only the data in the particular column. The "firm" and "location" columns are sorted lexicographically, the "pace" column numerically, and the "stage" and "track" columns by their inherently-defined orderings.

In the case where a search query is specified, or the topic filter is used, it is valuable to not only surface not only the resulting firms, but the best-matching investor at each firm (e.g. if the search query matches the first name of a partner). In these cases, there is an additional, non-sortable column titled "Partner", which displays the name and photo of that best match.

#### Initialization

When a founder first completes the signup flow for VCWiz, they are presented with a page containing functional real-time filtering, according to the above. To ensure a positive first experience viewing the results of filters, we make a few assumptions, and initialize the founder's filters to what we beleive are sane defaults. We set the funding round filter to "Seed", to reflect the target user of the platform. The industry and relevant startups filters are pre-filled with the industry and competitors of the founder's startup, respectively. Finally, the location filter is set to the nearest "hub city", relative to the founder's current location (based on their IP address). A "hub city" is defined as a city that has at least 50 venture firm offices (as reported by VCWiz) within it.

### Metrics

At the time of writing, there are 421,946 VCWiz research pages indexed on Google. From these, there are roughly 7000 impressions per day, resulting in about 100 clicks to the site. Similar stats are seen on other major search engines. There are between 200 and 300 founders that actively use the site on a monthly basis, with around 1200 founders that have used the platform actively at least once since the launch. These founders visit 1000 investor profiles monthly, for an average of four investors per founder per month. The majority of sessions. Of these founders that have signed up, just over 50% of them have granted access to their email inboxes for the purpose of tracking conversations with investors, and contributing anonymous, aggregate graph data for the VCWiz platform. These founders send and receive an average of 33 emails with investors per month. When considering how deeply founders are engaging with the research component of the platform, we see that, after filtering out sessions which last less than 10 seconds, 20% of the sessions since launch lasted at least 10 minutes, with 5% lasting over 30 minutes. The majority of this time is spent on the research pages generated for investors and firms. Interestingly, while founders tend to focus on the pages related to investors, they often come in through the pages focusing on a given company: 37% of incoming search traffic is for a company page, with 30% going to an investor page, and 20% going to firm pages.

### Diagrams

#### Models

The main models in VCWiz are Company, Founder, Investor, Firm, and Investment, each of which are self-explanatory. (* note that in diagrams, Firm is referred to as Competitor for legacy reasons). Each of these models is backed by a similarly-named database table.

The decision was made to have many \texttt{Company}s per \texttt{Founder}, as founders on the platform very often have started a company before. This leads to the denormalized \texttt{PrimaryCompany} model, which simply keeps track of which \texttt{Company} is the one a founder is currently leading. One current issue with the platform that results from this is that any founder can claim to be affiliated with a startup already in the system, whether or not this is true.

Each founder can own many \texttt{TargetInvestor}s, which represent a conversation between a founder and an investor (or an investor on a founder's wishlist). \texttt{IntroRequest}s and \texttt{Email}s are then affiliated with a \texttt{TargetInvestor}.

Tweets, news articles, and blog posts mentioning either an individual investor or entire firm are eached tracked by their own model. An \texttt{Entity} model that can be associated with any of these tracks mentions of extracted entities from the content, and is used for topic-based searching. In order to reduce noise in the selection of entities, we made the descion to only create an entity record if a given entity has an entry on Wikipedia [20].

#### Routes

The routing of VCWiz is split into the frontend application, resource paths which serve pre-compiled Javascript and CSS, and an internal API.

The following endpoints serve the pages for the frontend VCWiz application, which is a React app. The last section contains the pages that are auto-generated for search engines.

\begin{pre}
  /login
  /logout
  /signup

  /discover
  /outreach
  /filter
  /search

  /privacy
  /terms
  /founders/unsubscribe(/:token)

  /firm/:id(/:slug)
  /investor/:id(/:slug)
  /company/:id(/:slug)
  /list/:list(/:key/:value)
\end{pre}

These endpoints serve the pages that investors interact with on VCWiz. The first group is a React app which allows investors to claim their profile on the platform, and make edits to the information that is displayed about them. The second group are the pages which investors land on when accepting or rejecting an introduction request from a founder.

\begin{pre}
  /investors/token/:token
  /investors/signup
  /investors/settings
  /investors/contacts
  /investors/update_contacts

  /intro/opt_in
  /intro/decide
  /intro/pixel/:token.png
\end{pre}

These endpoints comprise the internal API, which largely serves to allow the React apps which comprise the frontend to create, read, update, and destroy resources on the server.

  /api/v1/intros/:id/confirm
